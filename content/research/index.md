# Research at Inferara

At the core of Inferara's mission lies a steadfast commitment to advancing the field of #Web3 security through continuous and rigorous research. Our research efforts are both the heartbeat and the braintrust of our operations, driving innovation and ensuring that the solutions we provide are not just current, but also future-ready.

## Our Research Domains

**Mathematical Theorem Proving**

We delve into the complexities of mathematical theorem proving with a focus on creating airtight security protocols for blockchain applications. Our work seeks to push the boundaries of what is possible in automated reasoning systems and formal verification methods. We use Rocq (Coq) as our primary theorem prover.

**Code Correctness**

Code is the bedrock of all digital systems, and its correctness is non-negotiable. Our research centers on developing methodologies that ensure code operates exactly as intended, eliminating vulnerabilities and enhancing reliability.

**Smart Contract Security**

As smart contracts become the backbone of an increasing number of digital transactions, their integrity is paramount. Our team investigates new ways to secure these contracts through formal methods to certify the correctness of implementations according to specifications, thereby eliminating flaws in contract logic.

## Our Approach

We believe in a collaborative approach to research, often partnering with academic institutions, technology think tanks, and industry experts to challenge, inspire, and elevate our work. Inferara is not just about solving the problems of today; we are also constantly thinking ahead to preempt the security challenges of tomorrow and building the systems to withstand them.

Our dedication to research and development is unwavering, and we regularly publish our findings to contribute to the collective knowledge of the #Web3 community. At Inferara, we're not just observing the evolution of digital security; we're defining it.
