## Go beyond bug finding. We analyze your project's core Design.

We provide a strategic, third-party analysis of your protocol's foundational architecture, uncovering flawed economic incentives and game theoretic weaknesses that audits will miss.

## Are Hidden Flaws Putting Your Protocol at Risk?

Catastrophic exploits often stem not from simple coding errors, but from deep, systemic vulnerabilities in a protocol's design. These design level flaws in economic models, governance structures, or cross-chain interactions are invisible to traditional audits.

Just take a look of the most recent exploits within just the last few weeks...
### Recent Protocol Exploit Examples:



* **The $11M Cork Protocol Hack:** On the 28th of May 2025 
a critical lesson in Uniswap v4 hook security was learned. A subtle flaw in a callback mechanism, not a simple bug, led to a complete drain of funds. This highlights the dangers of complex interactions between protocol components.

* **The $22.3M Cetus Hack:** On May 22, 2025 a shared library bug triggered a massive exploit, demonstrating how dependencies can introduce unforeseen attack vectors. True resilience requires analyzing the entire system, not just your direct codebase.

* **The Alex Protocol Exploit:** On June 6 of 2025 this incident exposed vulnerabilities in how protocols manage permissions and private keys, proving that technical security and operational security are deeply intertwined in the design phase.

## Our Solution: Personalized Protocol Design Analysis

We move beyond code level bug hunting to provide a holistic analysis of your protocol's conceptual and architectural soundness. Our methodology is built on three pillars to ensure fundamental resilience.

* **Formal Methods:** We use rigorous mathematical techniques to model protocol behavior and prove critical properties, providing mathematical guarantees of system correctness before implementation.

* **Algorithmic Languages:** We apply specialized, high-precision languages for the unambiguous specification of complex logic, ensuring your design intent is perfectly captured and analyzed.

* **Game Theory:** We analyze economic incentives and adversarial strategies to identify and mitigate potential exploits or undesirable outcomes, securing your protocol's economic layer.

## Our Expert Team

Our deep expertise is what truly differentiates Inferara. We bring together a rare blend of academic rigor and practical Web3 experience to provide unparalleled protocol design analysis.

One of our key team members, Dr.Maxim exemplifies this commitment to excellence and foundational understanding:

* **PhD in Influence of Additional Information Asymmetry on the Solutions of Non-Antagonistic Games** from  [St. Petersburg University](https://english.spbu.ru/). This specialized research directly informs our game-theoretic analysis of protocol incentives and adversarial behaviors.

* **MS in Algorithmic Languages** from [MSU](https://msu.ru/en/) This background provides a profound understanding of the precise definition and analysis of complex computational processes, crucial for formal specification and verification.

* **Published Researcher** with works featured on [Mathnet](https://www.mathnet.ru/php/person.phtml?option_lang=eng&personid=147678), demonstrating peer-reviewed academic rigor and thought leadership in relevant mathematical and logical domains.

* **Active Contributor to Web3 Foundational Research** on [GitHub](https://github.com/Inferara), bridging academic theory with practical, open-source development in critical areas like new programming language specifications (`inference-language-spec`), WebAssembly tooling (`inf-wasm-tools`), and formal specifications for blockchain components (`merkle-tree-wasm-spec`).

This unique combination of a strong theoretical foundation in formal methods and game theory, coupled with hands-on contributions to cutting edge Web3 infrastructure, ensures that our analysis is not only academically sound but also directly relevant to real-world protocol challenges and emergent vulnerabilities.
