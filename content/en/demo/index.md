# Protocol Risk Self-Check

**Discover potential design-level risks in your protocol through a guided assessment.**

This interactive tool walks you through key questions about your protocol's design, economics, and governance. Based on your answers, you'll receive a preliminary risk summary highlighting areas where Inferara's formal analysis could add value.

## Why design-level analysis matters

Traditional audits focus on code-level bugs, but many catastrophic exploits stem from:

- **Misaligned incentives** that create arbitrage opportunities or encourage harmful behavior
- **Edge cases in economic models** that break under stress or adversarial conditions
- **Implicit assumptions** about oracle behavior, gas costs, or network conditions that don't hold in practice
- **Governance vulnerabilities** that allow small groups to extract value or manipulate outcomes

Inferara's methodology uses formal methods and game theory to surface these risks **before** they become expensive problems.
