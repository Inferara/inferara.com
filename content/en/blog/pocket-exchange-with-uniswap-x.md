## Introduction

We wrote this blog post because we have completed a research we were hired to make to calculate the economical model of the UniswapX protocol from the game-theoretical perspective in trading. We found the ultimate idea of UniswapX and similar protocols very interesting because it enables substantial value holders to participate in the market-making process with less protocol and LP risks. This blog post is a great place for those who have capital and want to have a small (maybe not) in-pocket exchange that does not manage the orderbook itself and just fills the orders provided by Uniswap.

## UniswapX V1 and V2

> UniswapX V2 is the current (time the blog is published) actual and deployed on the mainnet version of the protocol.
{.note}

As usual, the comprehensive documentation about V1 and V2 is available on the Uniswap documentation site.

## Monitoring

Explain how to use Dune to monitor UniswapX, Fillers and so on. Share references on public dashboards we created.

## How to become a Filler
