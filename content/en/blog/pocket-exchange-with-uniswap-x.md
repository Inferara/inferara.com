Strategic Incentives in 1inch Fusion and UniswapX

## Introduction

We wrote this blog post because we have completed a research we were hired to make to calculate the economical model of the UniswapX protocol from the game-theoretical perspective in trading. We found the ultimate idea of UniswapX and similar protocols very interesting because it enables substantial value holders to participate in the market-making process with less protocol and LP risks. This blog post is a great place for those who have capital and want to have a small (maybe not) in-pocket exchange that does not manage the orderbook itself and just fills the orders provided by Uniswap.


Having become an integral aspect of the new digital economy, the decentralization of financial services—alongside its obvious advantages—has also introduced a number of problems that, until recently, burdened anyone who needed to move liquidity from one digital asset to another. For years, ordinary users of crypto exchanges have faced a familiar set of headaches: bots that “sandwich” other people’s swaps; sudden spikes in network load that send transaction fees sky-high; unpredictable slippage that renders the quote shown in the swap window largely meaningless. Early-generation automated market makers (Uniswap V2 and V3) addressed the problem of passive liquidity provision more than they corrected these inherent flaws in the act of swap execution itself.

This situation began to change meaningfully only with the rise of a radically new paradigm—intent-based swap mechanisms. Unlike the traditional approach, which places responsibility for preparing the transaction on the swap initiator (the user merely signs to release funds if the transaction is acceptable), intent protocols let users abstract away entirely from the details of the prepared transaction and its surrounding conditions. By signing a declaration of intent to swap X tokens of one type for at least Y tokens of another, the initiator delegates every other decision to the service—and thanks to smart-contract guarantees this happens in a trustless way: with a sound architecture, neither the service nor the selected counterparty can execute a transaction whose parameters deviate from the user’s declared intent.

Here we compare the two most influential realizations of this architectural idea to date—1inch Fusion and Uniswap X. Both stand on the solid foundation of a classic Dutch auction, yet they differ in implementation details significant enough to be economically interesting.

Let’s begin with a closer look at the conventional workflow whose shortcomings both systems aim to fix. In a standard trade (whether on an exchange or p2p via escrow), the initiator effectively self-services the entire process: they find a source of liquidity with sufficient depth (or several, for larger trades), transfer their tokens into escrow or onto an exchange (paying a network fee the first time), lock in the exchange rate (or abort if it has become unfavorable), and finally, again at their expense, withdraw the proceeds (or the unused input tokens) back to their wallet. Receiving the full amount thus depends on the success of the operation at each liquidity source individually—if a rate slips too far somewhere, the trader has to seek liquidity elsewhere, absorbing sunk costs for the failed attempt. Meanwhile, the time gap between choosing a liquidity source and the actual price lock-in inevitably tempts counterparties to manipulate prices for their own profit (MEV). This sorry state of affairs raises several pressing questions:

 • MEV threat: Can users be protected from bots that predatorily maximize the value extracted from others’ transactions by manipulating execution order?

 • Liquidity fragmentation: Can a user be given access to hundreds of disparate liquidity sources scattered across exchanges and private inventories, while abstracting away the integration complexity behind a simple, cost-efficient operation?

 • Sunk-cost risk: Can users avoid paying for transactions that—for whatever reason—end up failing?

Both 1inch Fusion and Uniswap X respond similarly. By reframing the operation as an auction of the swap order among professional executors, they flip the situation on its head. Making counterparties compete for the right to serve the client hits multiple targets at once:

 • Protection from failed transactions: In this model the user does not prepare the transaction; they simply sign—at zero cost—an instruction for the service to find the best executor for an order with specified parameters.

As usual, the comprehensive documentation about V1 and V2 is available on the Uniswap documentation site.
All network fees and potential losses from failure are internalized into the market spread, which executors minimize under competitive pressure by pricing risk accurately.

• Harnessing MEV for the client: Market makers’ entirely legitimate drive to maximize profit not only comes out of the shadows but also meets a natural check in the form of competition. The order is executed by whoever offers the best spread, and the price promised in the signed contract is fixed before funds leave the user’s wallet, leaving no temporal window for price manipulation.

 • Transparent aggregation of fragmented liquidity: Because the system merely enforces the contract between the parties, it does not require executors to pre-deposit funds to form a common liquidity pool. From the auction’s perspective it doesn’t matter where the tokens come from, as long as they land in the client’s wallet before the deadline. This allows executors to effectively resell all liquidity available in the market through a single window.

 It’s hard not to notice that while this economic model dramatically simplifies the swap for the initiator, it necessarily makes life more complex for the executors. Compared with classic exchanges—where participation can be as simple as depositing liquidity, posting a price, and passively waiting for buyers—the auction scheme forces participants on the execution side to make many more decisions under tight deadlines. Automation here is non-negotiable: a state of constant readiness with hard response times leaves a human no chance to beat robots. Below we dive into which economic decisions compel such automation on both platforms.

 Although 1inch Fusion and Uniswap X implement the same core idea schematically, they differ quite substantially in the design of their mechanisms. We’ll examine them separately and then compare.

 ## 1inch Fusion: The Classic Dutch Auction

This protocol embodies the “simple is elegant” principle. An order, parameterized by just three numbers (start price, reserve price, and auction duration), is listed in a continuous auction that begins at the most favorable price for the client and then linearly drifts toward the pessimistic reserve price over the auction’s duration. The auction (in the current version) is closed: executors must register and pass KYC. To act on a listed order, a participant executes the user-signed instruction to transfer tokens from the user’s wallet into a special bi-directional escrow that records the exact timestamp of its on-chain inclusion. The first to do so wins the auction; the resulting price is computed deterministically from the order parameters and the escrow’s recorded opening time. From that moment the executor enjoys an exclusivity period, during which they can fulfill their side of the deal by funding the opposite direction of the escrow with the required amount of the tokens the client wants to receive. The final step—also paid for by the executor—before the exclusivity expires is closing the escrow, which simultaneously releases the frozen funds in both directions.

If something goes wrong and the executor stops midway after freezing the user’s funds, then once the exclusivity period ends the act of closing the escrow becomes public: any wallet can, by paying the network fee, either return the user’s tokens in full (if the counter-escrow was never sufficiently funded) or complete the swap (if it was funded but the executor couldn’t close the escrow for technical reasons). To make public closure economically meaningful, the protocol requires auction participants to bond a small amount of their own funds in the escrow alongside freezing the user’s tokens—an amount sufficient to cover network fees. These funds are always paid to whoever signs the escrow closure: during exclusivity they are returned to the executor; after exclusivity they become a reward for the party that completes or cancels the swap, fulfilling the client’s needs in a way that remains transparent to them.

## Uniswap X: A Two-Stage, Differentiated Auction

This design is somewhat more complex, but for good reason. The protocol splits executors into two unequal groups that act at different stages. First to interact with the client’s order are registered, KYC-verified Quoters, whose work actually starts before the user signs anything. When the user selects a direction and types the desired amount (either what they want to sell or what they want to buy) into the form, a draft of the order is broadcast to all Quoters serving that direction. Each Quoter is expected to respond very quickly (within roughly half a second) with a quote—i.e., the complementary amount of tokens. If the client sells a fixed quantity of their tokens, the quote is the price the executor is willing to pay. If instead the client wants to buy a fixed quantity of the other token, the quote is the price at which the executor is willing to sell those tokens.

In both cases, Quoters compete to offer the most favorable quote for the client. The platform selects a winner, shows that quote in the swap form, and invites the user to sign a payment instruction. From that moment, the winning Quoter is considered to have taken on an obligation to honor the quote provided the user signs before a countdown timer (measured in minutes) expires. Execution of the signed instruction is also given a fixed, on-chain deadline; upon expiry, the overdue obligation is deemed breached and the client’s order is considered to have failed the exclusive stage. A Quoter who reneges is penalized with a temporary suspension from quoting new orders.

Only orders abandoned by their winning Quoters proceed to the second stage, which is a more archetypal Dutch auction much like the 1inch Fusion mechanism described above. The most economically significant difference here is that Uniswap X’s second stage is open to the public without registration. From the end of exclusivity until the auction reaches the client’s reserve price, anyone can act as the executor (a Filler), which should further compress the final spread by intensifying competition.

This added complexity is not wasted: by forcing first-stage Quoters to shoulder an obligation to honor the price shown to the user even before the user decides to swap, the designers create a valuable user-experience feature that would be hard to reproduce otherwise. By comparison, under 1inch Fusion the exchange rate visible to the client at signing time is merely an approximate, non-binding estimate by the platform; the final price is determined somewhere between the start and reserve prices during the (sometimes lengthy) auction. Under Uniswap X, in the overwhelming majority of cases the user decides to sign while looking at the actual amounts that will be sent and received almost immediately after pressing “Proceed.” That’s because Quoter defaults are relatively rare; the open Dutch auction plays the role of a safety net rather than the main workhorse.

A qualitative economic analysis suggests that this undeniably useful feature is not free for the user. The extra obligations and risks borne by Quoters in Uniswap X naturally push them toward more conservative expectations of execution profitability for the same nominal spreads. One should expect that for swaps involving more volatile tokens (or during volatile periods for otherwise stable pairs), the simplicity of the classic Dutch auction in 1inch Fusion will, on average, extract a smaller share of value from client orders.


Our practical experience—gained while economically advising a startup currently building an automated market maker (bot) for Uniswap X, and during a hackathon prototyping cross-chain trading functionality on 1inch Fusion—can be summarized as follows. Regardless of platform choice, an automated market maker for intent-based protocols is a mechanically non-trivial artifact whose success depends not only on solving the technical integration tasks with the platform’s services, but also on adopting a strategy that addresses two interrelated, economically substantial questions:

First, the bot’s effectiveness depends directly on its ability to price quotes quickly and accurately for the pairs it serves, and to adapt its pricing algorithms promptly to changing market conditions. The choice of primary signals used by the algorithm to determine the most advantageous quote is critical. Natural candidates include public data from centralized exchanges—mark prices for the trading pair and raw spot order-book data. These inputs enable quote-estimation algorithms that respond sensitively to market dynamics.

Second, any serious optimization of the bot’s profitability is impossible without close attention to efficient liquidity reserve management. Although intent-based protocols allow executors to draw missing liquidity from virtually any source available in the market at any time, maintaining adequate operational reserves on the bot’s own wallets can materially reduce transaction costs.
